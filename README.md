# HTML Karnaugh Map Generator

I started writing this to help me out with a homework assignment because I'm too stubborn to use LaTeX.

Then I realized this is actually much more work than I had anticipated.

So it's in this half-complete state, I use it as a scratchpad and just use the console and Inspect Element to draw the implicants.

## Features
- You can click on 0s to change to 1s or ds, etc
- Call addToImplicant(color,topLeftMinterm,bottomRightMinterm) from the js console to make a new implicant. e.g., addToImplicant("red",5,15) to draw an implicant covering BD. Note that this doesn't work across tables, ie when you're using 5 variables. Maybe someday.
- that's about it

## Todo
- Everything else
- See todo.txt

I might finish this project someday. I might not. Time will tell.
