# HTML/jQuery Karnaugh Map Drawing Tool

View at https://accellarando.github.io/HtmlKmaps/

I started writing this to help me out with a homework assignment because I'm too stubborn to use LaTeX.

## Features
- You can click on 0s to change to 1s or ds, etc.
- Put in the color and coordinates to draw an implicant.
- You can switch between 2, 3, 4, or 5 variables. 5 variables doesn't work across tables - maybe someday though.

## Todo
- Full support for 5 variables
- Download/export image
